## Initial task:

For this task, you'll need to learn how to use the Jitsi API by going through the documentation provided at https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/category/developer-guide. Once you've familiarized yourself with the API, your objective is to create a simple web application (Angular) that utilizes this API. Here's a basic outline of what you need to do:

1. **API Familiarization (Estimated Time: 1 hour):**
    * Go through the documentation provided by Jitsi to understand the features and functionalities offered by their API.
    * Pay close attention to how to integrate and use the API within a web application.

2. **Web Application Development (Estimated Time: 3 hours):**
    * Set up a new web application project
    * Integrate the Jitsi API into your web application according to the documentation.
    * Create a simple user interface that allows users to interact with the Jitsi features exposed by the API.
    * Test the functionality of your web application to ensure that it works as expected.


3. **Documentation and Submission (Estimated Time: 30 minutes):**
    * Document any challenges you faced during the development process and how you overcame them.
    * Provide clear instructions on how to run your web application locally.
            Submit your completed task within the designated timeframe.

Remember, the primary goal of this task is to demonstrate your ability to learn and use a new API within a limited time frame. Focus on understanding the basics and implementing a functional web application that showcases your ability to integrate and utilize the Jitsi API effectively. Good luck!
